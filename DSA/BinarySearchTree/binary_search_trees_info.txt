binary search trees(balanced) provide search, insert, delete and find  closest in O(log N) and sorted traversal in O(n)

binary search tree:
-----------------------

1- for every  node, keys in left side are smaller and keys in right side are greater

2- all keys  are typically considered as distinct

3- like linked list, it is a linked data structure

4- implemented in c++ as map, set, multimpa and multiset.


if the BST is not balanced all opperations on the  BST will be O(h) where h is the height of  the binary tree
