The problem: you are given a very large sorted array
and then you are asked to find the index of an element if present in the array
if that is not the case you have to return -1


for this question you would implement the following funciton
the time complexity of this implementation would be O(log(position))

int search(int arr[], int x){
	if(arr[0] == x) return 0;
	int i{1};
	while(arr[i] < x)
		i *= 2;
	if(arr[i] == x) return i;
	return binarySearch(arr, x, i/2+1, i-1);
}
