stack is a linear data structure

it is closed from one side and open from the other

the insertion opperation on stack a stack is called push and the removal is called pop

the main operations on stack are *not in a certain langueage, only the functionality matters here*

	isEmpty() : returns true if stack isempty else false;

	push(x) : inserts an item to the top of the stack

	pop() : removes an item from the top

	peek() : returns the top item

	size() : returns the size of stack

underflow:
	when pop() or peek() called on empty stack

overflow;
	when push called on a full stack



stack can be implemented using linked list and arrays / vectors
