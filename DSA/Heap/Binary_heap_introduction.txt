Binary Heap
_______________

	used in heap sort

	used to implemetn  priority queue

	two types

		min heap (highest priority item is assigned lowest value)

			complete binary tree

			every node has value smaller than its descendants



		max heap (highest priotity item is assigned lowest value)

			complete binary tree

			every node  has value greater than its descendants



	Binary Heap is a complete Binary tree (stored as an array)


	if a binary tree is stored as an array it is efficient in the matter that a complete binary tree does not have any gaps
	and every element related to a particaular node at an index i is obtainable with the following formulas

	left_child(i) = (2*i) + 1
	right_child(i) = (2*i) + 2

	parent(i) = floor((i-1) / 2)
