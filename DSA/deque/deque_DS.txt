deque stands for doubly ended queue

this is a data structure similar to the que, the only differece being the insertiona and deletion of both ends.

the opeartions that are possible on such data structures are (not based on any language)

* InsertFront()
* InsertRear()
* DeleteFront()
* DeleteRear()
* getFront()
* getRear()
* isFull()
* isEmpty()
* size()


for the implementations of deque you can use

	linked list (doubly linked list)

	array (circular array)



applications :
__________________

* can be used as both stack and queue

* maintaining history of actions

* a steal process scheduling algorithm

* implementaing a priority queue with two types of priorities

* maximum / minimum of all subarrays of size k in an array
